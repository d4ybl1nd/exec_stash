# intro

only shall scripts for now but i will add more bins/modularized files to be able to chain them. 
this is temp repo as it will be destroyed once i am certain what i wanna do with it.  

info.yaml includes absolutely nothing as they should be autogen-ed with premade structures but i haven't decided on data structure just yet. 

this is off-work/personal stuff, something like a hobby or for fun. 

As start off, i'm just adding super lightweight stuff.
i come to realise maybe, just maybe there's gotta be a checksum between exec chain.
